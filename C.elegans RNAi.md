### About RNAi in *C.elegans*

RNA interference (RNAi) is a widely used technique in which double stranded RNA is exogenously introduced into an organism, causing knockdown of a target gene. In the nematode, C. elegans, RNAi is particularly easy and effective because it can be delivered simply by feeding the worms bacteria that express double stranded RNA (dsRNA) that is complementary to a gene of interest. RNAi is frequently used to perform reverse genetic screens in order to reveal which genes are important to carry out specific biological processes.

### prepare plates

NG 2% plates with 1 mM IPTG and 50 µg/ml Carbenicillin (5 L)

	4.9	L	ddH2O
	100.0	g	Difco-Agar, Granulated (BD 214530)
	12.5	g	Bacto-Peptone (BD 211677 / BD 211820)
	15.0	g	NaCl

Autoclave and cool down to ~50°C, then add

	5.0	ml	Cholesterol (5mg/ml EtOH) (sterile) (Sigma C3045)
	5.0	ml	1.0 M CaCl2 (sterile)
	5.0	ml	1.0 M MgSO4 (sterile)
	125.0	ml	1 M Potassium Phosphate, pH 6.0 (sterile) *
	5.0	ml	1 M IPTG (sterile)
	2.5	ml	Carbenicillin (100mg/ml) (sterile)
	
and pour the plates.

*1M Potassium Phosphate is made by mixing 132 ml of 1M K2HPO4 and 868 ml of 1M KH2PO4
	or
 1M KH2PO4, pH 6.0 (adjusted by KOH)
